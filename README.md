Description
=============

SpatialDeltaGLMM has been fully deprecated, and all functionality is available in R package [VAST](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST).  Archived results for representative models are available in R package [FishStatsUtils](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishStatsUtils), and VAST uses integrated-testing to ensure that VAST generates identical results to SpatialDeltaGLMM.
