Description: SpatialDeltaGLMM is an R package for implementing a spatial delta-
    generalized linear mixed model (delta-GLMM) for use when standardizing fishery-
    independent index data for U.S. West Coast surveys with (2) built in diagnostic
    functions and model-comparison tools, and (3) is intended to improve analysis
    speed, replicability, peer-review, and interpretation of index standardization.
